    "# Computer Vision 2025 Assignment 1: Image filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will research, implement and test some image filtering operations. Image filtering by convolution is a fundamental step in many computer vision tasks, and you will find it useful to have a firm grasp of how it works.\n",
    "For example, later in the course we will come across Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which are a combination of convolutional filters learned to solve specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main aims of the assignment are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- to understand the basics of how images are stored and processed in memory;\n",
    "- to gain exposure to several common image filters, and understand how they work;\n",
    "- to get practical experience implementing convolutional image filters;\n",
    "- to test your intuition about image filtering by running some experiments;\n",
    "- to report your results in a clear and concise manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "*This assignment relates to the following ACS CBOK areas: abstraction, design, hardware and software, data and information, HCI and programming.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## General instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the instructions in this Python notebook and the accompanying file *a1code.py* to answer each question. It's your responsibility to make sure your answer to each question is clearly labelled and easy to understand. Note that most questions require some combination of Python code, graphical output, and text analysing or describing your results. Although we will check your code as needed, marks will be assigned primarily based on the quality of your report rather than for the code itself! We are more interested in your understanding of the topic but code clarify, logic, and commenting reflect tge depth of your understanding as well!\n",

    "Only a small amount of code is required to answer each question. We will make extensive use of the Python libraries\n",

    "- [skimage](https://scikit-image.org) for image loading and processing\n",
    "- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html) for displaying graphical results\n",
    "- [jupyter](https://jupyter.org) for Jupyter Notebooks\n",
