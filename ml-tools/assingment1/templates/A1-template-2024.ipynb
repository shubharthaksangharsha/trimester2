    "# Using Machine Learning Tools: Assignment 1\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will apply some popular machine learning techniques to the problem of predicting bike rental demand. A data set has been provided containing records of bike rentals in Seoul, collected during 2017-18.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scenario for this assignment is that you are a new employee of a company (that rents bikes, alongside other activities) and you have been assigned the task of predicting the bike rentals. Your line manager has given you some instructions (those shown below) but is expecting you to be able to do this task without close supervision and to report back with understandable and concise text, graphics and code (and of course the company wants a copy of all the code required to perform this task). Naturally, you are wanting to show that you are a valuable member of the company and although the company allows the use of ChatGPT, you will want to show that you are making useful contributions and that you bring value to the company beyond just being able to type instructions into ChatGPT, as otherwise the company might replace you with a cheaper data entry employee. Hence, you should use ChatGPT whenever you like (or whenever instructed to - see later) but do highlight how your own knowledge and judgement makes a contribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main aims of this assignment are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- to practice using tools for loading and viewing data sets;\n",
    "- to check data for common pitfalls and clean it up;\n",
    "- to plan a simple experiment and prepare the data accordingly;\n",
    "- to run your experiment and to report and interpret your results clearly and concisely.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment relates to the following ACS CBOK areas: abstraction, design, hardware and software, data and information, HCI and programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is divided into several tasks. Use the spaces provided in this notebook to answer the questions posed in each task. Some questions require writing code, some require graphical results, and some require short comments or analysis as text. It is your responsibility to make sure your responses are clearly labelled and your code has been fully executed (with the correct results displayed) before submission!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do not** manually edit the data set file we have provided! For marking purposes, it's important that your code is written to be able to be run correctly on the original data file.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating graphical output, label is clearly, with appropriate titles, xlabels and ylabels, as appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the tasks in this assignment only require writing a few lines of code! One goal of the assignment is explore [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html) and other libraries you will find useful throughout the course, so feel free to use the functions they provide. You are expected to search and carefully read the documentation for functions that you use, to ensure you are using them correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 2 of the reference book is based on a similar workflow to this prac, so you may look there for some further background and ideas. You can also use any other general resources on the internet that are relevant, including ChatGPT, although do not use someone else's code or answers that directly relate to these questions. If you take a large portion of code or text from the internet or ChatGPT then you should reference where this was taken from, but we do not expect any references for small pieces of code, such as from documentation, blogs or tutorials. Taking, and adapting, small portions of code is expected and is common practice when solving real problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code imports some of the essential libraries that you will need. You should not need to modify it, but you are expected to import other libraries as needed.\n"
